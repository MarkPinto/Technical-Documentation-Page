			            <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.</p>

			            <p>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.</p>

			        	<p>Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.</p>
			            <p>Below is an example of HTML:</p>

			            <pre>
			            	<code>
&lt;p>This is a HTML &lt;p> element!&lt;/p>
							</code>
						</pre>
			        </section>

			        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
			        	<header class="header-size">Getting Started</header>
			            <p>There are many tools that can be used to create and edit web pages, since html documents are composed of text any text editor can be used such as the text editors that come preinstalled with your operating system. However, those text editors are barebones compared to text editors tailored toward developing which come with features that can assist with web development. These features include suggestions while typing allowing you to save time, providing the basic template for an HTML file with keyboard shortcuts, and giving access to a dark theme which may be easier on the eyes among other features.</p>
			            <p>Here is a small list of reccomended text editors for web development:</p>
			            <code>Placeholder text</code>
			            <ul>
			            	<li>Sublime Text</li>
			            	<li>Notepad++</li>
			            	<li>Atom</li>
			            	<li>Brackets</li>
			            	<li>Bluefish</li>
			            	<li>BBEdit</li>
			            </ul>

			            <p>There are many other text editors not listed above that can be used as well; in additon to these other editors there are also online services that provide text editors for creating HTML documents such as CodePen. CodePen has the added benifit of keeping all of your work in the cloud so you can login into your account and access your work without having to make sure to take a copy of your work with you.</p>

			        <section class="main-section" id="Your_First_Web_Page">
			        	<header class="header-size">Your First Web Page</header>
			            <p>In order to get started with your first web page all you need to do is open up your text editor of choice and start with the most basic skeleton of an HTML document.</p>
			            <p>Start off your page with the following:</p>
			            <pre>
			            	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
	&lt;head>
		&lt;title>&lt;/title>
	&lt;/head>
	&lt;body>
			            		
	&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>Now fill in the title of the page and add content to the body such as a &lt;p> element.</p>
			            <pre>
			            	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
	&lt;head>
		&lt;title>My Web Page&lt;/title>
	&lt;/head>
	&lt;body>
		&lt;p>Welcome to my web page&lt;/p>		            		
	&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>Save the above HTML document with the .html extension and when you open it up with a web browser it will result in a web page that displays the text "Welcome to my web page" as well as the title "My Web Page" on the tab that has your document open.</p>			            
			        </section>

			        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_Style">
			            <header class="header-size">Adding Style</header>
			            <p>HTML is used to organize the content on the page, the content on the page can be further enhanced through styling with the use of CSS which is also known as cascading style sheets. In order to start styling your HTML, start by connecting a sheet to your document using the &lt;link> element in the header as shown below.</p>
			            <pre>
			            	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
	&lt;head>
		&lt;title>My Web Page&lt;/title>
		&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
	&lt;/head>
	&lt;body>
		&lt;p>Welcome to my web page&lt;/p>		            		
	&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>The style element above connects a CSS document named style.css in the same directory as the HTML document. After making this link it's time to make the CSS file. This can be done using the same software mentioned in the getting started section. Let's start by making our paragraph element red. This can be done through two methods, one involves styling all &lt;p> elements and the other involves making use of classes  which let you style more selectively. Lets start by styling all &lt;p> elements.</p>
			            <pre>
			            	<code>
p
{
		color: #CCCCFF;
}
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>Now all &lt;p> elements are the color periwinkle. Now let's try using classes, your CSS will not chnage much, we will call our class periwinkle.</p>
			          	<pre>
			            	<code>
.periwinkle
{
		color: #CCCCFF;
}
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>As you can see we only replaced the element that was defined which the &lt;p> element and replaced it with a name with a period at the begining. Now in order to selectively style we must add class="periwinkle" within the opening brackets of the element we choose to stlye.</p>
			            <pre>
			            	<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
	&lt;head>
		&lt;title>My Web Page&lt;/title>
		&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
	&lt;/head>
	&lt;body>
		&lt;p class="periwinkle">Welcome to my web page&lt;/p>		            		
	&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
			            	</code>
			            </pre>
			            <p>That is the basics of CSS, there are many styling options besides color and many other methods to style elements but this will get you up and running.</p>
